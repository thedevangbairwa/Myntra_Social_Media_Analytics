### README: About These Excel Files



You have received two versions of the same Excel workbook:

Macro-Enabled File (.xlsm) – Includes VBA scripts and automation features.

Standard Excel File (.xlsx) – Contains only the data and formulas, without any macros or automation.



#### To Use the Macro-Enabled File (.xlsm)

Macros are disabled by default in Excel for security reasons. To access the full functionality of the .xlsm file, 

please follow these steps:



Step-by-Step: Enable Macros and Adjust Security

* Open the .xlsm file in Excel.
* If you see a yellow security warning bar at the top, click "Enable Content".
* Go to File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings.
* In the Trust Center window:
* Select Macro Settings.
* Choose "Enable all macros" (recommended only if you trust the source).
* Check "Trust access to the VBA project object model".
* Click OK to apply the settings.
* Close and reopen the file to activate all macro features.



#### Safety Note

Only enable macros from trusted sources. This file contains automation designed to improve your experience, 

such as navigation buttons and custom controls.
